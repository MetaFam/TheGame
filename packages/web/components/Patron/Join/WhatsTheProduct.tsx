        There are a few, actually, along with various monetization &
        sustainability strategies. If you want to dig deeper, it might be best
        to dig down the raids section & ask some questions or read the

      Why you should become a Patron of MetaGame?

        We prefer our patrons inrinsically motivated, so the main reason you'd
        want to become a patron is just the fact you love this whole idea of
        MetaGame & want to see it succeed. If you werenâ€™t so damn busy, youâ€™d
        probably join in on building it, but at this point, its easier for you
        to just pitch in a bucket of water & support the movement passively.
