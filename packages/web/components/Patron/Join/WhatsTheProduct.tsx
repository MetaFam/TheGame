        We prefer our patrons inrinsically motivated, so the main reason you'd
        want to become a patron is just the fact you love this whole idea of
        MetaGame &amp; want to see it succeed.

          If you werenâ€™t so damn busy, youâ€™d probably join in on building it,

          water &amp; support the movement passively.
