This is a custom configuration for tsconfig-paths to be able to "fix" 
relative paths at runtime (in node.js) in the Docker container.  tsconfig-paths 
"just works" for local dev, but this extra configuration is necessary when 
running in Docker since at that point we're just running the transpiled 
javascript in the dist directory.
