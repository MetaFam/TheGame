# WTF is MetaGame ? 
## Society Changing Ideology Backed By Game Changing Technology ! 

MetaGame is an antidote to apathy, an experiment in online coordination, an MMO-RPG (Massively Multiplayer Online-Role Playing Game) except with real money. *Well with as real-o-money as any money is...*

In actuality MetaGame is a MetaDAO looking for solutions to social coordination. We try not to think too much about who is to blame for the mess we find ourselves in because when you zoom far enough out it’s easy to see that no one group or one industry is soley responisible for creating the issues we now face globally. It may simply be that local people focusing on local needs is not the best outcome for the global population. Instead we are choosing to build something that forges a new path into uncharted territory, with untested mechanisms, and a high risk of failure. We are afterall the YOLO generation ! 

## Why Are We Doing This ?
We are doing it because we are woke: to the reality of living systems, to the splendor of natural ecosystems, to the beauty and simplicity of life on earth. And most of all because we want to see things continue to stay beautiful and alive. 
We are building MetaGame because we care, because we can, because we refuse to believe in fairy tales, and we no longer beleive that others will do something before it’s too late. We are the others, the time is NOW! 
We are motivated to find solutions that scale the commons in the same way that bees are motivated to protect and expand the colony. There’s something inside of each of us that says “it’s up to you”, we're invested in solutions that go beyond our local or regional borders, we don’t care about the status quo, we don’t care about politics, we have no interests to protect, we’re doing it because what greater game can one play than the game of life.

## Who is "We" ?
We are a swarm of hackers, thinkers, idealists, dreamers, visionaries and crackpots from all corners of the globe. We are listeners who hear the message being shouted from rooftops all around the world, we are seers who envision a better future for ourselves and the generations to come, we are doers who jump into a projects asked or not and find ways to be helpful, we are advocates of open-source technology, we are humans who believe in the power of collaboration and its ability to unite us in discussion, shared responsibilities and shared rewards, we are the next iteration in the traits of humanity. We are **YOU** and you are one of us! How are you/we going to do this? **Technology is the way and the life**, without technology humans are unable to be as connected as they need to solve massive issues. Using new languages of code and computer programs we are able to hard wire our individual incentives to match the global incentives of a connected community.

## What Makes This Different ?
Open source, DAO’s, and non-entities. Structures such as these have never before existed in the human realm. We are ready to integrate and collaborate with all of our competition and share the findings of our research to create something greater than the sum of its parts. Everything being done is is being done with new tools, and as such will require new states of minds. We believe the results of this experiment will open a **pandoras box** of learning that will forever raise our understanding of what's possible through intentional human coordination to new heights. 

## Where Do We Start ?
Start right now, wherever you are, by asking some questions on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/metafam), by tackling a quest on [Discourse](https://forum.metagame.wtf/c/quest/5/l/latest?board=default), or by falling into the rabbit hole on the [Wiki](https://wiki.metagame.wtf/) and seeing where you end up.
