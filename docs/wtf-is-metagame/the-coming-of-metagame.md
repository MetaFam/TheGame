# The Coming of MetaGame

## Out of nowhere?

Well, not really. I have been waiting for someone to do it, ever since my brain was first occupied by this “_Ethereum world computer_” meme;

> “Holy shit! This is the software infrastructure layer we need for a fair socioeconomic system of the future!”

It is only now that I said: _I’ll be damned if I don’t at least try._
## Why now?

Back in May, Peter published a call-to-action article titled “[Rising threats to Ethereum’s first mover advantage](https://medium.com/metacartel/rising-threats-to-ethereums-first-mover-advantage-6138bd6c860)” which introduced me to the colorful bunch you might know as the _MetaCartel_.

He receives my message, and a week later, he’s onboarding me to the _MetaCartel_ — over a burrito and some ale, after the “Year of The DAO” meetup in Ljubljana, where I set out to meet him.

Coming into _MetaCartel_ looking for problems — I noted a few things missing that would be useful for a rapidly expanding network:

-   Some sort of a guide — introducing people to what we’re about, and how to find your place among us,
-   Repositories of ideas, solutions, members — and their needs and offers,
-   A map of the whole thing.
    

## MetaCartel Blackpaper v0.1

You may, if so curious, go and scroll through this [original paper](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RZw3l3wDxrZuyVW0j-ipbFDyy-_xUtmMqSd4wo2STjQ/edit) including the illustration above — but it has been long abandoned.

I must have been writing it for no longer than 3 days, when Peter contacted me again, saying:

> _“Hey, I like what you’re doing, here’s 1k DAI of the funds Binance gave me!”_

It’s not a lot of money, but it’s a lot of affirmation — getting money without asking for it? Usually not even in crypto.

## Onwards

As my work on the paper progressed, more crucial elements were added:

-   Titles — knowing who’s accountable for what, keeps things moving and makes it easier to navigate the cartel.
-   Achievements — knowing who did what, also pretty useful.
    

And with the idea growing from a simple way of making the _MetaCartel_ easier to understand and oversee, into… this; I needed to go out and meet more fellow _carteleans_, get some feedback and some apostles.

So I got my ticket, helped put together the “_MetaCartel Mansion_” and boarded the plane to Berlin.

Besides the _MetaCartel Demo Day_, my pilgrimage went around _DappCon_, _Token Engineering_, _Governance Games_, _ETHBerlin_ and whatever smaller event wasn’t too far off the trail — the folk seemed receptive to my meme, to say the least...

Not having known I needed to register, devious tactics had to be deployed.

-   My debt towards the folk of _ETHBerlin_ was wiped by my helping the Odyssy _([DAOHaus](https://daohaus.club/))_ team, not just shillin’ muh own shie’.
    

During the final hours of the hackathon, while waiting for the team presenting to the judges — my hand started sketching up the UX flowchart.. This is what came out:

> The left represents some of the components, the middle 1/3 represents the player journey, and the right side is the value proposition.

Thinking through this complex system where not just people, but institution, may join — it became obvious there was a problem…

-   If the _Moloch DAO_, _Ethereum Foundation_, or _ConsenSys_ wanted to join, they would probably not want to be under the _MetaCartel_.
-   Let alone some people from outside crypto…
    

It became apparent that _The Game_ has to be a layer above. _The Game,_ was no longer to be called _MetaCartel;_

-   The game is to be called _**MetaGame.**_
-   The concept behind it coined; “_**A Massive Online Coordination Game”**_

## Genesis

The first _MetaGame_ presentation was held by a lake with a wooden stick pointing at _the paper_ laying on the ground — and that’s about all you need to know about that faithful day…

I traveled back home, almost missing my flight;

-   The following day, awakening from my 16 hour slumber, MetaGame was *ON*
    

And that’s how MetaGame was born;
