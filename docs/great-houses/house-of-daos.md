<summary>🤨👉Wait, WTF are DAOs???👈</summary>
<br />

Short for “Decentralized Autonomous Organizations”, DAOs are a new type of organization, enabled by blockchain technology. Decentralized organizations are nothing new, what makes DAOs different from “just” decentralized organizations is that they are constituted on the blockchain and their governance is, at least in theory, controlled by smart contracts.

This allows people to start organizations with complete strangers from around the world and not worry whether one of them will run away with the money, where will the organization be formed and how will they govern the treasury. The ownership of a DAO is usually tokenized and distributed among members, with its issuance not centrally controlled by anyone.

There are multiple types of “decentralizations”. Some will say “A DAO” only implies architectural decentralization; the technology itself. While one may _have_ “a DAO” whose governance is centralized in a single or a few big shareholders, we do not consider those true DAOs.

If you ask most of us, a DAO should be both architecturally AND politically decentralized to truly be considered a DAO. For a DAO to be considered politically decentralized, it’s voting power should be _sufficiently_ decentralized among its members. How much is sufficient? Well who the hell knows, we’ll figure it out.

If you ask me, DAOs are here to enable us to build a world of cooperatively ran organizations and collectively owned platforms & infrastructure.

### To recap:

- There is no centralized control in the DAO. There is no “CEO” and no single individual may dictate direction.
- There isn’t a hierarchy in any traditional sense, no “managerial” & “executive” layers.
- Members allocate resources and make decisions about the direction and initiatives through voting on proposals or practicing other decentralized decision-making methods, eg. [Holacracy’s Integrative Decision Making Process](https://medium.com/org-hacking/holacracys-integrative-decision-making-process-f750d4b82abc)
- There is complete transparency in every transaction.
