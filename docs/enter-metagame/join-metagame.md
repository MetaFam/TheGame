You didn't think we just let anyone in, did you?
There are two ways to prove your worth & join MetaGame 🙃

## Join as a Player
The first step to joining as a Player is to subscribe below.
From there, you'll be invited to discord where you'll need to prove your worth in one way or another ⚔️

## Join as a Patron
Eager to support the cause & impatient to join?
You can skip the queue by joining as a Patron instead!
- Water our seeds by depositing WETH [here](https://pools.balancer.exchange/#/pool/0xea05a15dbce2eb543ffda16950e95b2bd2e40d0e/)(Make sure you deposit enough WETH to generate 8 pSEEDs.)
- Enter [here](https://discord.gg/d3rurFAK6M) & type in "!join"

Want a more in-depth guide to doing this? Check the [Patrons Path](https://www.notion.so/Patron-Path-1db90c8bb4c84398a6fe1f672ea5e855).

## Join as a Guild
We are currently not accepting new guilds into MetaGame & the list of candidates to join next is long. Want your project to be considered a candidate for the next batch of *Guilds of MetaGame*? Join as a player or a patron now, shill your project & make some friends.
