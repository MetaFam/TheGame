> **Patron**
> 
> _**A person who really want to see MetaGame succeed but is too busy to contribute labor, so they contribute by buying & planting Seeds.**_

If you’re anything like us, you believe that the path to a better world is not through involvement in politics & bureaucracies of the old world but through building of a new system from scratch, using the latest technologies available.

-   A new socioeconomic operating system
-   Its why you’re in crypto, no?
-   It’s what we’re about.

So!

1.  You like MetaGame but don’t have time to contribute
2.  You become a patron

It should be simple as that.

…

But its not.

-   Is the time of people supporting projects simply because they like them, gone?
-   Do people now support projects only for the possibility of financial gain?
-   Have crypto ROIs ruined our intrinsic motivation system?
    

Gawd I hope not 😅

But let’s proceed as if yes.

## Why should anyone buy Seeds

Let me restate it again for additional emphasis. **YOU SHOULD BUY SEEDS BECAUSE YOU WANT METAGAME TO SUCCEED.**

So, maybe go read the [manifesto](https://wiki.metagame.wtf/docs/wtf-is-metagame/metafam-way)?

-   Not really vibing with it?
-   Doesn’t make you want to become a Patron of MetaGame?
-   So just don’t, m’kay?

Now that we got that out of the way once more - we _are_ planning a bunch of usecases for Seeds which should make them, well, useful. There’s been a full post about it recently, you can find it on Notion - **[🌱 Usefulness of Seeds](https://www.notion.so/Usefulness-of-Seeds-56358863654746738052ab2e1a8fdade).**

Some of these uses are available right now, ask about them in **[#💸-spending-seeds](https://discord.gg/cBq5Md6KTU)**

## Why should Ether whales buy Seeds

Well, we’re building an onboarding machine for the people who want to build dApps & DAOs in the Ethereum ecosystem.

If that isn’t enough for the Whales of Etherea to support MetaGame, idk what is.

## Why speculators should buy Seeds

This is crypto. Ever heard of Dogecoin? Unisocks, anyone? Dogecoin is a literal meme coin with a marketcap of 6.5 BILLION dollars, Unisocks are Uniswap branded socks that are currently worth $150k a pair. _**Now, these are pure memetics; think about how far memes paired with an actual productive usecase & a vision for a better future could go.**_

MetaGame is currently in seed phase with a marketcap of just over $1m. Do you really think the price of Seeds will stay ~$45 forever?

Then again, it might go to 0 🤷‍♂️

## Why should people plant their Seeds

![](https://cdn.substack.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F07e25e26-3ae5-404e-9dd5-8018538dccea_487x284.png)

**Well, because Seeds are for planting.**

While there are no explicit farming rewards, everyone will need to plant their Seeds before MetaGame enters Phase II.

-   Phase II token - _Trees_ - will be given to those who plant their Seeds, not those who hodl them, just waiting for price to increase to flip them.
