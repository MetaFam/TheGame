_A Massive Online Coordination Game_

## Abstract

> _“Metagame is any approach to a game that transcends or operates outside of the prescribed rules of the game, uses external factors to affect the game, or goes beyond the supposed limits or environment set by the game.”_ - From Wiki

Players of MetaGame are on a quest to change the way people coordinate around solving problems & creating value.  
  
The quest stretches from fixing the onboarding to the Ethereum space  
by symmetrifying information & composing the basic socio-economic infrastructure, to grappling with actual problems.  
- You know, the opposite of the first crypto-world problems.  
  
But, it all starts with Seeds...

## Seed Phase

The main goal of Seed phase is to build a hub for anyone interested in decentralized  
organizations & applications.  
Guides & portals to anything one might need to build them & a community of people to support them.  
  
We’re building a _Decentralized Factory_ for baking the building blocks we are going to use to compose the bigger picture.

## The Bigger Picture

The long term goal of MetaGame is to build an alternative society; a global society focused around solving problem - not squeezing the world for profit.  
  
We are building the future we want to live in:

-   A more collaborative, transparent & decentralized future.
    
-   A future in which human progress isn't accelerating its destruction.
