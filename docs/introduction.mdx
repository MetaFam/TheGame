Think of it as a *real-life MMO-RPG*. More importantly, it is an experiment with the goal of creating better ways of organizing societies; societies in which self-interest is better aligned with the common-interest and societies in which life feels more meaningful while work is more fun.

Digging further will tell you all about what MetaGame is (or wants to be) in an overly optimistic way, but:
-   It is *not* a Utopia.

Furthermore, a lot of the things you will encounter will be of laughably low quality or outright stupid. 
What you need to keep in mind is that *everything* in MetaGame is *minimum viable*; when you see something you don't like, you should see it as a challenge for you to improve it.

And the same way everything here is minimum viable, so should your expectations be.

Every element of MetaGame is a debatable and an ever-evolving community effort.
