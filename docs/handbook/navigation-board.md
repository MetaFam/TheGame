## XP & Seed DAO
This is the basis for the MetaGame's economic system. Check the XP & Seeds page to learn more.
- We've launched a new DAO :white_check_mark:
- Now it's time to launch the Seed market.
- This will allow players to finally redeem some monies for XP earned.

## Skill Trees
We need to make it as easy as possible for the people just getting started in remote work to find out what they could be learning/doing. 
- We're mapping out knowledge of the skills needed in a remote world.
- We need people to contribute their knowledge of whatever branch of knowledge needed around here, and help us build this tree.
