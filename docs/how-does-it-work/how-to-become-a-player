This is a bonus quest. As mentioned at the beginning of this wiki, ***all of this*** is just a work in progress. If you consider yourself more of a scholar than a doer, help us see the blind spots and expand on the MetaGame lines of thinking.

- Report inconsistent or out of date content, or suggest new content on the [forums](https://forum.metagame.wtf/t/i-think-we-should/141) or in [the tavern](https://discord.gg/axebUqq). 
- Or just start further clarifying & extending the content yourself.
### ✅ To complete:
- This is where the magic starts. Regardless of whether you posted your improvement or suggestion on the forums or on github - if other players find your contribution valuable, you will automatically be rewarded XP.


## Now what?
Now you try wearing some hats and see which ones fit you best :)
