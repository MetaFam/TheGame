title: 🌒 Phases of MetaGame
---

## **Phase I: Seed**

> _Elon Musk: We spotted what appears to be an octopus at the edge of the Solar System. It looks like a baby but it's half the size of the moon and it appears to be heading our way. Just 2020 things 🤷‍♂️_
>
> Weeks later...
>
> _NASA: This morning we’ve received a distress signal. After mocking our information technologies, she seemed to have started sobbing; claiming to be lost and dying of thirst._

The main goal of _Phase I_ is to build a hub for anyone interested in decentralized organizations & applications. A library of guides & portals to anything one might need to build them & a community of people to support them.

The meme of this phase is _A Decentralized Factory_; a collective of decentralized teams, churning out the building blocks we’re going to use to build a decentralized world.

### Goals:

-   Build a community of people strongly aligned with the _MetaManifesto_.
-   Set up the basic socio-economic infrastructure.
-   Assemble the initial resource base.

### Builds:

<details>
<summary>MetaLibrary</summary>
Currently "MetaGame Wiki"; MetaLibrary is a crucial piece of building MetaGame.
Right now, there's mostly content about understanding MetaGame, but it will over time skew more and more to being a wiki about building decentralized organizations & applications in general.

<details>
<summary>MyMeta</summary>
MyMeta is your access to MetaGame. It starts as simple profiles to make it easier for you to display who you are and find other players but evolves into a place where you can do things like display & sell your NFTs, as well as your dapp dashboard.

On the other end, it evolves into an app which you've seen the first glimpses of if you've visited https://wiki.metagame.wtf/home

This includes a bunch of other projects we've been working on that we also consider mission-critical but not as big of a deal as the above two.

- Such as MetaMaps, our web3 whiteboarding/project management tool we'll be using to build the *Skill Trees* & and the *Navigation System* to help people move through MetaGame.

- Such as organizing the [first virtual conference in the Ethereum space](https://medium.com/@pethereum/sure-the-future-is-remote-and-virtual-conferences-will-be-a-thing-but-we-arent-doing-this-just-bd0eaef8132d) back in March & the [first DAO-focused hackathon](https://metagame.substack.com/p/fork-the-world-hackathon) back in August.

- Such as the MetaView podcast which we use to paint the picture for the community by interviewing the brightest minds in the space.

- Such as the Achievmintry, which we'll be using to show appreciation towards the builders in the Meta and the wider Ethereum ecosystem.

- Such as... You get the idea.

## **Phase II: Growth**

> _Gently, she descended into the Atlantic Ocean. We were worried about the oceanic life, but she assured us she only feeds on h2o & co2 - she doesn’t stop blowing our minds. First, her decentralized technologies, and now this? She might turn out more useful than we thought._

Proven ourselves worthy; _Seeds_ grow into _Trees_ & we summon _The Great Flood._
A wave of capital flows into MetaGame and it allows us to pay even more people to do awesome things - like grappling with real-world issues.

So we zoom out of crypto and start onboarding people from other high-tech, but also ecological & philanthropical communities; MetaGame starts looking more like a federation of guilds & alliances than one single community.

The meme is _A Web of Opportunity_; there is no lack of funding nor a lack of problems to solve. Anyone can just jump in, start solving problems & earning an income.

### Goals:

-   Summon _The Great Flood_.
-   Spread tentacles into all high-leverage technologies.
-   Start solving problems outside of crypto.


### Builds:

<details>
<summary>MetaVille</summary>

It's when MetaGame gets the actual game-like interface. You're able to walk around in spatial audio environments, attend meetups in the tavern, hang in your guildhouse, tend to your crops & access all the learning, media & work content you need to progress.


This is not to say we won't be working on this while still in Phase I, in fact, more than one player has tried championing this raid never to be seen again.
You can read a longer post about it here. If this sounds like something you'd be able to tackle - we'd be happy to supply you with some Seeds!

What do I look like, some alpha leaker?

No, I'm not giving you MetaGame's alpha!

Maybe ask me again when you reach the Diamond League. ;)

Not going to write much about this either. As the phase info suggests, it's when we start taking real-world issues seriously by contributing to ecological & philanthropic initiatives etc.

If the world hasn't gone to shit: these hackathons, conferences & other types of gatherings should be more regular and happening in-person as well.

There should be the starting of the Outpost Network; a network of hacker-houses, ecovillages & other kinds of spaces that players may live & work at.

There should also be hundreds of other, smaller initiatives, experiments & projects.

## **Phase III: Equilibrium**

> _It’s been years since we spotted her drifting towards us. Her technologies helped us overcome coordination failures & her presence here turned out greatly beneficial for our ecosystems. She’s all huge & covered in greenery now; looking more like a breathing landmass than an octopus._

MetaGame now really _is_ a _massive_ online coordination game. By now, we have onboarded players & guilds offering anything one might need to live a rich & meaningful life in MetaGame. There’s also anything from co-working & co-living spaces to ecovillages, being offered & even built through MetaGame.

As the name suggests, MetaGame is no longer focused on rapid growth but sustainable growth in the state of equilibrium. It can thrive & grow without any additional injections of speculative capital.

The meme of this phase is _A Web of Life_ - to support life as a whole.

### Goals:

-   Support a mass of people in doing something meaningful & making a living.
-   Onboard co-working/co-living spaces as well as off-the-grid farms & eco-villages.
-   Get deep into ecological & philanthropic initiatives.

### Builds:

<details>
<summary>MetaFrame Alpha</summary>

You can think of it as a basic operating system & a manual for building and operating communities/societies/metagames. A combination of building blocks & methods we're using to build MetaGame, generalized, explained & improved for others to use.

More in the Minimum Viable Stack article soon.

While there isn't a lack of ideas for the late stages of MetaGame, Phase III is likely 5+ years away so making any predictions more specific than "we'll be doing things that the people need" would be kind of...

If there's one thing to be expected of this phase, it's that by now crypto technology has moved into the background and we're focused on building & nurturing the web of life by sustaining more and more people in doing good things & supporting good causes.
